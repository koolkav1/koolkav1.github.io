 I am a front-end developer with a keen interest in user experience. What does that mean? It means that I am constantly exploring new ways to improve the user experience. I can achieve it through design and I can achieve it through code.

My ideal role is to become a Principal Front-end Architect. Yes, such a role does exist and I have done my research. However, It will just take me a while to get there. I guess the saying is true, you can't climb Everest in a day.
I am currently a technical graduate for Leidos working in front-end technologies and using the .NET MVC to achieve results. 

I have started the journey by choosing one core main JavaScript framework called Vue JS primarily because I learned Angular JS during my final year project in university to build a cross-application. I already have started to use Vue JS in the workplace and I shall be using it for my personal projects as well.

I can think of four personal projects that will grow to get me to the top, I will be pursuing these project one at a time to ensure I still remain sane. I have a few hobbies that I would still like to keep intact while I pursue my dream job. I like to go for salsa dancing on Tuesday evenings and Bachata on Thursday evenings. I also run the [Leeds Social Society](https://www.meetup.com/social-society-leeds/) on Meetup where I regularly organise social events for professionals to have fun. Thus, I shall not be giving up my Friday/Saturday nights or maybe fortnightly.
