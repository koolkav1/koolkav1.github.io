This is a very random project. I have been following Free Code Camp blog on Medium for a while now and I totally loved their idea where they taught refugees how to code.

I need to improve my JavaScript skills and to ensure I am a patient, good teacher. Why not, do both? I will teach someone who has never written code before and help them get on their feet.

There are several drawbacks here, I also need to ensure my own safety, I need to think of a curriculum, assessments, their current skills, do they even know how to use a computer?  How did they get homeless? Was it drugs, their mental health, their lack of hygiene? So many things to consider. 

Nonetheless, I will devote two hours of my week to this project. As the local library closes at 6 pm during the week. Therefore, 5 to 6 pm on Monday and then 5 to 6 pm on Wednesday evening. The dedication and completion of tasks ultimately have to come from the mentee. As part of good faith, I will purchase the homeless individual a Tesco or Morissons meal deal so the hour they spend in the evening, they will not lose out.

I see a homeless person every day to and from work. I have asked him if he wants to learn to improve his IT skills and learn to code. The first class is on Monday 9th of April where I will assess his current IT skills. I then will be following Free Code Camp's curriculum to ensure he learns enough skills to apply for a Junior Web Developer position after six months. While I do this, I will actively ask digital agencies, if they can offer him a position, if and when he reaches a decent competency.
